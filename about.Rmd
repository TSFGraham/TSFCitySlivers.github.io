This website was created by The Sierra Fund to facilitate the City of Nevada City with their "City Sliver Program".
This website was generated by N. Graham and M. Furumi using RMarkdown and publishing through The Sierra Funds Github account.
The website is still under the design stage with both visual and data updates occurring frequently. 
If you experience any technical difficulties please email Nick Graham at nick.graham@sierrafund.org.
